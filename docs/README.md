## Purpose of This Section

**This is where big ideas live.**

Not the day-to-day coaching work. Not the tools that help with games. This is the "what if" and "someday maybe" thinking.

**Questions explored here:**
- Could this coaching approach scale beyond one-on-one training?
- What would an AI-powered coaching platform look like?
- How do you preserve authentic coaching methodology in digital form?
- What's the business model for democratizing elite coaching?

**Important distinction:**
- Main Court = proven methodology being used now
- Docs = vision for how methodology might scale someday

## Key Strategic Themes

### From Kabir's App to HoopDreams Platform

**The origin story:**
- Built simple training app for Kabir's India trip
- Realized it solves solo training challenge globally
- Discovered potential to scale coaching methodology
- Vision evolved from MVP to platform concept

**Platform possibilities:**
- "ReciMe for basketball drills"
- Clip drills from social media
- Organize personal drill library
- Build practice plans
- AI coaching assistance (CoachFlo)

**Current decision:** Repository first, platform later (maybe)

### Neurodivergent Athlete Coaching

**Market gap identified:**
- 10%+ of youth athletes are neurodivergent
- No existing platforms address this specifically
- Coach D has specialized expertise
- Opportunity for differentiation and mission alignment

**Research questions:**
- How does ADHD/autism affect skill acquisition?
- What coaching adaptations work best?
- How to scale specialized coaching knowledge?

### FloState Integration

**Connections to broader work:**
- Basketball as domain for testing optimization frameworks
- Flow state and peak performance
- Mental game and mindset training
- Cross-domain pattern recognition

## Document Status Levels

**Vision** - Big picture possibilities, no commitment  
**Strategy** - Directional thinking with some research  
**Planning** - Concrete next steps being considered  
**Reference** - Historical context, completed explorations

Most docs here are **Vision** or **Reference** — ideas worth capturing but not active projects.
