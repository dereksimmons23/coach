# Cascadia Life Magazine - Creative Brief

## Branding & Cover Design Notes

### Masthead & Branding
- **CDN branding**: Place on Page 3 with the Masthead
- **Cover date treatment**: Month Year worked into negative space in Cascadia Life logo in a lightweight way on the cover

### Secondary Line for Cascadia Life
Something short and punchy would be good for a secondary line. The "guide," "season," "theme" and even "premiere issue" parts could be baked into the live cover type.

**Example concept**: *Cascadia Life: A pick-me-up for the PNW*

(Note: This is a starting point - we should riff on better ideas during the art direction session)

### Open Question
What unique words or vibes are totally PNW other than coffee and beer?
