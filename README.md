# Coach D - Basketball Development Repository

**Current Location:** `/Users/dereksimmons/Desktop/coach/`  
**Built by:** Derek Simmons (Coach D)  
**Created:** December 20, 2025  
**URL:** coach.claudewill.io (future deployment)  
**Purpose:** Organized collection of basketball coaching tools, methodology, and resources

---

## What This Is

A repository where Coach D's basketball work naturally accumulates. Not a business. Not a platform. Just an organized place for tools, methodology, case studies, and resources.

**Philosophy:** Build tools when you need them. Document what works. Share what helps.

## How This Works

**As a repository:**
- Tools get added when they're built and working
- Resources get documented when they're ready
- Case studies get written when stories are complete
- Nothing gets forced before it's useful

**For Claude Code:**
- Clean structure for agentic development
- Each section has its own README
- Clear organization for automated workflows
- Easy to navigate and extend

**For sharing:**
- Parents/players can find resources
- Other coaches can use tools
- Clear documentation for everything
- Professional presentation without overselling

## Integration with Derek's Ecosystem

**Part of the broader claudewill.io universe:**
- **claudewill.io** - Main hub
- **bob.claudewill.io** - (TBD)
- **ebb-flo.claudewill.io** - FloShake methodology
- **coach.claudewill.io** - Basketball (this repository)
- **CW Strategies** - Consulting business entity

**Philosophy:** These aren't separate projects. They're different domains of the same work — helping people optimize performance across contexts.

## Key Principles

**From tonight's conversation:**
- "We built an app that works in a few hours. It would have taken nearly as long to find a PDF and fill it in. That's the whole game."
- Repository, not platform
- Accumulation, not launch
- Useful over impressive
- Coach language, not marketing speak

**From Kabir's training:**
- "Pay it forward for your brother"
- Basketball as extension, not escape
- Operating system > outcomes
- Joy in the work, not just the results

---

## Documentation Standards

**File naming:**
- Descriptive, lowercase with hyphens
- Version numbers when iterating (v1, v2)
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD when relevant

**README files:**
- Every section has one
- Explains what belongs there
- Lists current contents
- Notes what's coming

**Status tracking:**
- Clear "what's done / what's next"
- Time estimates when relevant
- Decisions documented in HANDOFF.md
