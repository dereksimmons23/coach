1 Come up with an idea first.
2 Then the product.
3 Then figure out the team.
4 Execute.

Is the start-up idea mission driven?
Is it a derivative of something that already exists?
Why now?

Convictions in own beliefs
The truly good ideas don't sound worth stealing
One that not many other people are working on

Needs to take over a small but very specific market
How is the market going to evolve? Will it be big in 10 years?
Should be easy to explain, no more than a sentence

Think about the market first. Begin with demand, meet with supply

Product: Anything that customers interact with for your company
Build something that users love, not just like (talk to users)
Growth by word of mouth, case studies, examples
Very few start ups die from competition (most die because they are not loved)
Great products win (be fanatical and create fans)
Create feedback cycle .. what they like ... would they pay for it ... would they recommend it? Use metrics to keep yourself honest

You can't not do it (passion play)
The world needs you to do it
The world needs you to do something else?
Founder burnout/depression
Keep momentum going, keep stacking up Ws

It's a process backed by science and sweat, enabling anyone to be a virtuoso of their next masterpiece.

Vision: We believe life and sport hit different in the FloState. We believe everyone has the ability to become a permanent resident of this state, where there are no limits, rules or regulations. It does, however, require a tax, and one you must pay daily to get there and to stay there. Physical mastery is part of the equation, and it requires sweat equity. How mental, emotional and spiritual fitness factor into overall calculus of Flow State like compound interest. With time and a lot of work, anyone can master a physical skill. Flow State unlocks peak performance to optimize and normalize the most important condition of all, the human condition.

- Get To > Have To
- Yes, Me! > Why Me?
- The compound interest of getting 1% better every day
- Be a doer, lead by example (unleash your superpowers)
- Be a helper and a great teammate (help others unleash their superpowers)
- Discipline > Motivation
- Consistency > Intensity
- Process > Outcome
- Curiosity+Creativity+Competition+Courage+Compassion = CIQ 
- Celebrations, Joy
- Quitting is the only true failure
- Wisdom > Knowledge
- Discernment to understand the things we can't control
- Agency to act on the things we can control
- The present is a gift (measure yourself against what you can do today, not what you did yesterday or what you might be able to do tomorrow)
- Authenticity not attached to role or outcome
- Relationships as genuine bonds of trust, respect and understanding
- Well Lopsided (not well balanced, Christina Wallace)
- Through lots of work, Flow State finds us rather than us randomly running into it
- Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast

As individuals and teams, everyone's shared goal through competitive endeavors is to reach the Flow State, the zone where distractions melt away, peak performance feels effortless, and the mind, body and spirit are in perfect harmony. Getting there is elusive, staying there is next to impossible. Until now.

During flow state, you unlock a sense of effortless attention to the task at hand—as a result, being in the flow can be an energizing experience. So yes, Ultra Instinct was the flow state for Goku where he focused solely on fighting. His body moved on its own, indicating that he was in a state of immense concentration.

The term “flow state” describes a mental state in which a person is completely focused on a single task or activity. They are directing all of their attention toward the task, and they do not experience many thoughts about themselves or their performance. Some people refer to this informally as being “in the zone.”


Mihaly Csikszentmihaly (1997) is a Hungarian-American psychologist who first coined the term for flow state. He described it as individuals who are “in the zone.” That could happen when musicians play a really involved and challenging piece; artists create in a consistent and blissful state; and writers continue to put words on the page at a frenetic pace. 

"intense and focused concentration on the present moment; merging of action and awareness; a loss of reflective self-consciousness; a sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity; a distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered; experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding."

Csíkszentmihályi describes the mental state of flow as "being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."

Flow involves an immersion and an energized focus. You’ve probably encountered this before when you’ve begun to lose track of time doing something fun and energizing. For most of you that includes playing games. Playing our favorite games puts us into that flow state: a state of complete absorption from which we become blissfully unaware of the outside world. 

Living a life of meaning and of depth requires us to step outside of our comfort zones, to challenge our own ideas and create innovative ways to optimize our time on this earth. The mental state of flow catapults our minds out of the mindless humdrum of everyday life and closer to a meaningful existence.

Some say that "wu wei" is similar to being in the "flow state". In both states, you might feel like you're effortlessly creating something, or that you're moving with an external force. However, others say that "wu wei" is more like "getting out of your own way". Wu wei is a Chinese concept that means "effortless action", "inaction", or "inexertion". It's a key concept in Daoism, and is also important in Confucian Analects and Chinese statecraft.

Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person in an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and success in the process of the activity. Flow is completely focused motivation. It is a single-minded immersion and represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in the service of performing and learning. In flow, the emotions are not just contained and channeled, but positive, energized, and aligned with the task at hand. To be caught in the ennui of depression or the agitation of anxiety is to be barred from flow. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task.

Measure/Journal/Analyze/Track

Flow State is the dream state, but it's components are applicable throughout the stages leading up to it. Principles of Flow State will propel you through and help keep you there.
- Novice (curious)
- Amateur (interested)
- Professional (invested)
- Master (all in)
- Flow State (all in, and it looks easy)

Four stages of building habits (Cody Toppert)
- Unconsciously Unskilled (we don't know what we don't know)
- Consciously Unskilled (we know we must improve)
- Consciously Working (We know and are improving)
- Unconsciously Skilled (We don't have to think about it to do it)

Skill triangles (Drew Hanlen)
- Skill at the top of the triangle (example: finishing)
- Breaks down to micro-skills under the peak of the triangle (foundational concepts)
- Under those micro-skills are tactics (brushing teeth) 

Creating opportunity through intensity and focus
- Do nothing = Pure chance
- Undirected hustle = Luck finds you
- Focused hustle = You find luck
- Unique hustle = Good fortune becomes destiny





Be a Lion
The lion is not the biggest animal of the jungle. The lion is not the tallest, strongest, smartest or fastest either. And yet the lion is the undisputed king of the jungle because the lion:
• Is patient but persistent and always in the present
• Is fiercely loyal yet never fears being alone
• Waits with confidence, walks with purpose and runs with courage
• Believes it is unshakable and ultimately unbeatable
• Knows every other animal is prey
• Does not lose sleep over the opinions of sheep
• Does not compromise or negotiate with itself
• Is prepared for anything, fears nothing, dares everything
• Sees challenges as opportunities
• Sleeps for 20 hours, works for 4 hours
• Knows the difference between wisdom and knowledge
• Understands failure is not an option and doesn't believe in Plan B
The lion is the embodiment of being in the Flow State. It is a permanent resident that outworked all other animals to get there and competes with itself every day to stay there. The lion is the ultimate athlete of any game. Be a lion.
