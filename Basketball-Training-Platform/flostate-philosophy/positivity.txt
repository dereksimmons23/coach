If you knew you could do one thing that would always bring you closer to winning, would you do it? Of course! All the time, right? So, do you always approach things with a positive attitude?

It is easy to be positive when things are going well. Most people can score baskets or accept awards with smiles on their faces. But will you look for the positive when it is hard to find? Can you view an iffy situation with a constructive mindset? Can you find the good in the people around you? 

Is your natural bias to solve the problem or lament your situation? 

Greatness depends upon your ability to find the positive in every situation.

There are not many guarantees in life, but I can guarantee this one thing. Adversity will find you at some point. As you quarterback your way through life, life at some point will intercept your best pass; return it for a touchdown, and then dance like Deion Sanders in your end zone. 

Life, my friends, is gonna hit you from the blind side on occasion. Your ability to conjure positive thoughts at precisely this moment will determine how your game will end.

Just as you work daily to sharpen your physical basketball skills, you must work to improve your ability to be positive at all times. This is the most important skill you can develop, no matter what you do.

But beware! Along the way, “haters” will try to bait you into sharing their special brand of misery. A hater, simply put, dispenses hate. Haters are easily identified. They are the ones that get no joy from your joy, no satisfaction from your success. Haters are the most poisonous people you can have in your camp. Don’t be a hater and don’t tolerate them around you.

Winners, as do we all, lose some games, but they always remain in the game. They refuse to retire to the sidelines. They always have another act, another card to play, another reason to rise from the turf. Winners can’t seem to get the vision of the next victory out of their head.
