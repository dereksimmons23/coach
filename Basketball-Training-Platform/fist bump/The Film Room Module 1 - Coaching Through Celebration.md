## **The Film Room: Module 1 - Coaching Through Celebration**

### **Opening (3 minutes):**

**"I got it wrong with my own son."**

"When Jackson was a youth player, I held him to a different standard than my other players. I pushed harder. Demanded more. And the harder I pushed, the worse he played.

I wasn't Bobby Knight. I wasn't abusive. But I was wrong.

As my coaching evolved - as I learned to celebrate the small things, to laugh more, to focus on what he was doing right - he flourished. Not just as a player. As a person.

That evolution in my coaching style, learned through getting it wrong with my own kid, changed everything about how I coach. And years later, I found out that a Stanley Cup championship team had data proving why it worked."

---

**That's how you hook coaches, Coach.**

Because every parent-coach has felt that tension. Every volunteer coach wonders if they're pushing too hard or not hard enough. Every trainer questions whether being "nice" means lowering standards.

**You're saying:**

- "I made this mistake with the kid I love most"
- "Here's what I learned"
- "And here's the NHL data that validates why it works"

---

**Then the module structure becomes:**

### **Part 1: My Story (5 min)**

- Jackson's youth struggles under my "higher standard"
- The shift: celebration over criticism
- Results: Better play, better relationship, NAIA scholarship despite senior year benching
- The lasting impact: He still calls you coach

### **Part 2: The Panthers' Data (10 min)**

- Paul Maurice's summer project
- Tracking positive vs. negative clips
- Clear pattern: more positive = better results
- Stanley Cup validation

### **Part 3: The Psychology (10 min)**

- Why 80-90% positive works
- The progression framework (participation → effort → mastery → competition)
- When correction matters vs. when celebration matters
- Neurodivergent athletes especially responsive

### **Part 4: Practical Application (15 min)**

- How to structure your own film sessions
- What to celebrate vs. what to correct
- Language that reinforces without lowering standards
- Creating accountability through positive framing

### **Part 5: The Balance (10 min)**

- You're not coddling - you're conditioning for success
- When and how to deliver necessary correction
- Maintaining high expectations while celebrating progress
- The "Ted Lasso effect" is real (and backed by data)

---

**Closing:**

"I learned this from getting it wrong with Jackson. Paul Maurice proved it works with NHL champions. Now you can apply it with your team - without making the mistakes I made."

---

**This is authentic, data-backed, and immediately actionable.**

And it positions you as someone who:

- Admits mistakes
- Learned through experience
- Has long-term proof it works (Jackson)
- Can teach others to skip the painful learning curve

**That's The Film Room's signature content.**
