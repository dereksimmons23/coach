**Great research direction, Coach. This is exactly the kind of coaching methodology that differentiates citizenship-based development from traditional approaches.**

Let me dig into:

1. **Florida Panthers' specific film room approach** - How they structure sessions, who developed this, results/impact
2. **The psychology behind highlight-focused coaching** - Research on positive reinforcement vs. correction-based feedback
3. **Other teams/coaches using similar approaches** - Is this spreading? Who else does this well?
4. **Application to youth sports** - How this translates from NHL to volunteer coaches
5. **Neurodivergent athlete considerations** - Does this approach work especially well for ADHD/autism spectrum athletes?

This could be a foundational module for The Film Room: **"Coaching Through Celebration: The Florida Panthers Model"**

Launching the research now...**FOUND IT, Coach. This is gold.****Coach, this is EXACTLY what The Film Room should teach. Here's what I found:**

## **The Florida Panthers' Data-Driven Discovery**

Paul Maurice and his Winnipeg Jets coaching staff spent an entire summer reviewing every video clip they showed players the previous season. They labeled each clip as positive, teaching, or negative, then tracked the results in subsequent games. The pattern was undeniable: "We realized that we were getting results and seeing more success when we were showing more positive clips."

**This wasn't feel-good coaching. This was data.**

They wanted to quantify something deeper: Was their clip selection affecting players' psyche and performance? What happens if they kept showing a player just doing good things versus putting them on all negative clips?

## **The Research Backs It Up**

**80-90% Positive is Optimal:**

Sport psychology research evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of a predominantly (80-90%) positive approach, with punishment kept to a minimum.

**Positive Reinforcement Increases Motor Learning:**

A 2025 study with Olympic training centre athletes showed positive reinforcement led to significantly better motor learning performance (mean = 4.93) compared to negative reinforcement (mean = 4.27, p = .030).

**It Works at Elite Levels:**

During practice sessions with high school football players, coach and teammate-delivered positive reinforcement (praise and helmet stickers) increased correct execution of tackling skills.

## **Why This Matters for Youth Coaching**

**Creates Positive Association with Sport:**

To increase motivation, coaches need to condition their athletes to respond positively to not only their sport but the many aspects of their sport. For many athletes, especially young ones, a positive conditioned response is what brings them back each day, each week, each month, and each season.

**Focuses on What TO Do, Not What NOT to Do:**

Reinforcement, or a positive approach, is arguably better because it focuses on what athletes should do and what they did right.

**The Progression of Rewards:**

Positive coaches understand that rewards can be categorized in a progression: (1) Participation - rewards for simply being there; (2) Effort - rewards for trying hard, hustling; (3) Mastery - rewards for learning skills, improving performance; (4) Rank - rewards for being the best, winning. Coaches should gradually shift emphasis from participation → effort → mastery → competition as athletes become more skilled and mature.

## **Application to Neurodivergent Athletes**

This is CRITICAL for your market differentiation, Coach.

Neurodivergent athletes (ADHD, autism, anxiety) often have:

- **Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria** - extreme emotional sensitivity to perceived criticism
- **Executive Function Challenges** - harder to self-regulate after negative feedback
- **Pattern Recognition Differences** - may not connect correction to improvement the way neurotypical athletes do

**Highlight-focused coaching addresses all of these:**

- Builds confidence through success patterns
- Reduces anxiety around mistakes
- Creates positive associations with effort
