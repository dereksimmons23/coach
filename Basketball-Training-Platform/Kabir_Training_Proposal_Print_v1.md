## WHY IN-SEASON TRAINING?

Most players stop individual development during the season, focusing only on team practice and games. The best players do both — they complement their team training with focused skill work that:

- **Enhances school team performance** (doesn't conflict with coaching systems)
- **Manages fatigue and prevents injury** (smart training, not more training)
- **Develops signature skills** that separate them from competition
- **Improves game IQ** through film study and tactical preparation
- **Builds confidence** for pressure situations

**In-season isn't about adding more — it's about optimizing what's already there.**

---

## MONTHLY TRAINING BREAKDOWN

### **Four 60-Minute Sessions** ($400 value)

Each week at the YMCA, structured around school schedule:

- Skill Development (35 min) — Ball handling, shooting, finishing
- Game Situations (10 min) — Live play scenarios, decision-making
- Cool Down & Weekly Review (5 min) — Goals and adjustments

**Training Philosophy:**
- Quality over quantity — focused, intentional skill work

### **Commitment Bonuses**

**Why longer commitments work better:** In-season development requires consistency. Monthly commitments make it easy to stop when the season gets tough — but that's exactly when training matters most. To reward families who commit to the full journey, we include game/film review bonuses:

**Monthly Payment ($500/month):**
- Standard monthly program
- Cancel anytime with 30-day notice

- **BONUS: 1 Live Game Observation or Film Review**

**Full Season Commitment ($3,000 for 6 months):**
- Pay for full season upfront
- Complete in-season development cycle
- **BONUS: 2 Live Game Observations or Film Reviews**

**Game/Film Review Details:**
- I attend a school game to observe real-time performance
- OR we review game film together (in-person or via Google Meet)
- Detailed breakdown of decision-making, positioning, execution
- Post-review conversation and adjustments to training focus
- Typically 60-90 minutes of my time per review

---

## PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY

**Life happens. Basketball is demanding. We adjust.**

- **Heavy tournament week?** Lighter session or reschedule if needed
- **Injury or illness?** Sessions pause, text support continues, focus on mental/film work
- **Schedule conflicts?** Flexible session times that work around school commitments
- **Academic stress?** We talk about balance, not just basketball

**For Monthly Commitments:** 30-day cancellation notice required (complete the current month)

**For Trimester/Full Season Commitments:** If circumstances change significantly (season-ending injury, family emergency, etc.), we'll work something out. I'm not here to lock families into impossible situations.

**This program adapts to Kabir's needs, not the other way around.**
