Dear Kirti,

Thank you for our conversation yesterday and for entrusting me with Kabir's basketball development. I'm excited to work with him as he prepares for the ERHS freshman team tryouts. Below is a comprehensive training plan that we can discuss and adjust as needed.

## Training Approach & Philosophy

Based on my evaluation and our assessment, I've designed a program to help Kabir break into the **top 20** of the incoming freshman class, with the ambitious goal of making the **top 10**. This will require significant improvement while leveraging his existing strengths.

### Four-Phase Training Structure

#### **Phase 1 (May): Foundations**

- **Focus:** Fundamental skill correction, especially left-hand development
- **Emphasis:** Proper technique before adding speed or defensive pressure

#### **Phase 2 (June): Skill Building**

- **Focus:** Post techniques, ball handling decision-making, passing vision
- **Emphasis:** Adding defensive pressure and physical contact to skill execution

#### **Phase 3 (June–July): Game Application**

- **Focus:** Translating skills to game situations, building confidence
- **Emphasis:** Competitive scenarios with increasing difficulty

#### **Phase 4 (August–September): Tryout Preparation**

- **Focus:** Position-specific skills coaches will evaluate in tryouts
- **Emphasis:** Full game simulations with feedback on tryout performance metrics

## Physicality Development

As we discussed, physical play will be a cornerstone of our training. I'll use football blocking dummies and other equipment to:

- Teach proper contact initiation and absorption
- Develop finishing moves through contact (especially with the left hand)
- Build confidence in post-up situations against stronger players
- Simulate rebounding against physical opposition
- Eliminate hesitation when facing physical defenders

This physical development is often overlooked for players transitioning to high school, giving Kabir a significant competitive advantage.

## Investment & Payment Details

- **Total investment:** $3,000 for 37 sessions (includes $700 discount)
- **First payment:** $1,500 due next week to secure all time slots
- **Balance due:** By September 1st

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the program. I'm looking forward to helping Kabir achieve his goal of making the high school team.

Best regards,

Derek
