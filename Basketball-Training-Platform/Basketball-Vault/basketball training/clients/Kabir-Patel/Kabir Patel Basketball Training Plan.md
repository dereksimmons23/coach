## Coach's Evaluation

> "Great candidate for the ERHS Freshman B Squad. Extremely hard worker and loves to play basketball. Was one of our better players, and has an insatiable appetite to work on getting better as a player. His dad was a big help throughout the season, doing our game book and/or clock, and supporting us during practices. Kabir is going to spend the summer doing basketball training and is planning on playing AAU ball as well. He'd be worth a close look at high school basketball tryouts."

2. **Build a Comprehensive Player Profile**
3. **Develop Relationships with Coaches**
4. **Track Progress and Update Materials**

## Kabir's summer checklist

- [ ] Have to stand out (25 guys ahead of you; get into Top 10)
- [ ] Physical presence. Own the paint. (expect/deliver contact)
- [ ] Offensive rebounds and put-backs
- [ ] Efficient scoring in the paint
- [ ] Communicator with positive energy
- [ ] Hip-hop music on D. (playlist of Kendrick, Kanye, Eminem, Drake, Travis Scott)
- [ ] Blues/Rock music on O. (Royal Blood, Muse, Foo, Celeste, M. Kiwanuka)
- [ ] Understand how to run **any** offense of defense or specialty play
- [ ] Study everything **Izzo** has ever done to the point you could draw up plays.
- [ ] Study ever element of **KD's** game, from offseason training to the Olympics.
- [ ] **Neuroplasticity:** Learn to do everything left/right hand & left/right foot.
  - Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt by forming new neural connections and reorganizing existing ones in response to stimuli. This adaptability allows the brain to adjust to new situations. It's a continuous process that occurs throughout life, allowing for learning, memory formation, and thriving through variables.

Things I want to remember

Pivoting

Taking contact 

Getting low and getting to the paint

Note

I think I did good but I just have to get more reps of that stuff in to build  Neuroplasticity to get better with both hands and to get better in game
This is from our last session
Things I want to remember

Spinning off the defender

Making space after contact

Getting to my spot quickly

I think I could have finished more creatively and could have been faster when getting to my midrange and made my seal more hard and more explosive

Very good, Kabir. Keep this up. It will help you come to each session with a clear picture of what you’ve done and what you want to work on. Make notes after each high school session as well. And remember to greet Coach Peltier each day and thank him and the staff after. Every time. Great work today!

I’ve been saying bye to him but he’s usually talking to one of the other guys 10 grade and beyond
So it makes me feel kind of awkward because it’s like a bye from him but he sounds like he just wants to get it over with

Yes. This is normal. Do it anyway. It will become a habit and he will remember that you took the time to engage. Half of the battle with any training is turning awkward or uncomfortable into a new normal. It makes a difference. Trust me.

Hey coach I had a question, so I was at camp today and there is this one defender that I’m not completely sure how to get by. He would always have his chest facing the right side of the court. Kinda baiting me left and I wasn’t sure what to do, so I went right and tried to make contact and push through but he was like a wall and I couldn’t get past him with just contact on my right so I did a step back. But I’m not sure if going right was a better option than going left in that situation. What are your thoughts on that?

That’s a good one. Quick answer: we don’t attack shoulders. We attack feet. If his right foot was high, we attack it. He’s not baiting you left. He’s giving you left. This is why Chris Paul was impossible to defend. He wasn’t right or left handed. He was both. We will rep this out at our next session. 

So I went left on that guy at camp today and he pretty much had no defense against it because he was so turned to the right

Yep! Well done! 

Things I want to remember

Getting to my side step

Creating space in various ways

How to get my shot up quick

I did a good job shooting the ball now I just have to be able to control my body so that I can keep my balance and stability under control and be able to lock in when I’m tired so I get the best chance of making my shot

Coach I have a question if someone is playing defense square to me how am I supposed to play it, same question if someone is playing on my hip 

Things I want to remember

Using my kill dribble to create space

Using my left hand when my when the situation calls for such as to make space or get a better shot off

How to change speed to make space

I shot pretty good but I need to be able to make those quick decisions whether to shoot or cross over on the kill dribble, and I need to implement the fact that slow doesn’t always mean bad and fast doesn’t always mean good into my mindset

Get 50 right 38
Get 50 left 26
38/50 banks
Get 50 right 43
Get 50 left 23

Things I want to remember

Staying low on my shuffles

How to use my kill dribble to create space to shoot or get a layup

How to shoot under pressure of time 

I have to learn how to not be hasty when going to the cross over or shooting during a kill dribble and I have to make my shots better under pressure of time because of the game situations that may come and I have to practice staying low because that is what will make me shifty and snappy and make it harder for people to get past me when I’m on defense.

I was playing against these 16 and 17 year olds and when I would play defense on them they would always just push through to the paint and push through me and hold my arms down when they would keep getting past me the same way and a few times I stopped them but the rest of the time they would do that. And I’m not sure how to guard against that besides just absorbing the contact. Do you have any advice on that?

Yes. We can work on that this week. Some of that street ball stuff won’t fly in organized basketball, although it’s good for you to both defend that type of play, and learn to do it on offense. This is why training with the boxing glove and football blocking pad are critical in your development. You’re learning to become a naturally more physical player. Your speed and strength training is also important. But how much protein are you getting a day? General rule is one gram for every pound of goal body weight. If you want to weight 180 pounds, 180 grams of protein per day. It will help bulk you up, especially since you are burning so many calories per day training. You need to be eating like an athlete. We can talk more about it on Tuesday!

Ok, I’m not sure how many grams of protein exactly I get a day but I think I get around 110-120 grams a day cuz I drink 2 protein shakes a day 30-32 grams of protein, I have my Indian food that’s probably around 20 grams in 3 meals, and I eat protein cereal in the morning which is 25 grams of protein. I weigh about 131

You should start tracking it. Don’t just guess. Measure. There are free apps that can help you keep track. Start with just tracking protein. If you’re getting 110 grams per day, set a goal of getting 130 for the next couple of weeks. It will help not only with muscle growth but recovery.

I put it though a nutrition app and asked my mom if she thought it was accurate because she makes all my food for me and it came up to about 3,347 calories 490 g of carbs 173 grams of protein and 80 grams of fat

Yes, all good. One month is not a long time. Just keep tracking daily and measuring weekly. Hit this protein goals and have a specific weight goal in mind for November 2025. Something like 145 pounds. Then 155 as a sophomore, 165 as a junior, and 175 as a senior. Each year, drop a percentage off the body fat. From 10 percent now to 9, 8, and then 7. You need to be lifting and training during the school year, and not just during the summers, which are short. Map out what you want to do between now and tryouts in November (about four months) and also 1-4 year goals. People overestimate what they can do in a few months, but they also underestimate what they can do in a few years. Keep logging everything and write in a journal. This will help you keep track of what’s working and what isn’t. And then you can adjust every couple of months.

I’ve been training even during the aau season and before summer with the same schedule as I do now which is just Monday Wednesday Friday and working out at home all other day and practicing by myself self for 2-3 hours everyday and playing 1v1’s 2v2’s etc against other players for around 1-1.5 hours everyday and then also training with you.

	Things I want to remember

Dragging and snatching to create space and use the defenders momentum against them

Knowing when to decision make to shoot or to pump fake sidestep and then shoot

How to lock in my free throw form and get right into it and shooting it the same way every time

I have to work on my ability to make my shots like my free throws mid ranges and threes even when I’m really tired. But I also have to work on my float dribbles and covering enough space with those float dribbles to go into whatever is needed in the situation like a shot or step through etc.

Also I’ve been using those moves that we’ve been learning and they really do work against people like that drag and kill dribble, really makes it hard for them to recover fast.
Also the creatine has been working too I’ve been feeling stronger and more energized even hit a new db bench press pr with 

Kabir Patel:

Kabir Patel:
	You were asking me what my bracelet said right
	It means fearless in Spanish 
	It helps me to remember to fight all the challenges that might come my way and to always strive to get better and to never just be ok with being average and also not to run away from from games and other things against better players and to run towards that so I can become better
	My Spanish teacher gave it to me at the end of the year

Derek Simmons:
	Awesome. Love that. 


Things I want to remember

How to float dribble to create space

How to tell when to step back and when to spin off contact

How to make my dribbles smooth to get into my shot quickly and efficiently 

The biggest thing I have to improve is my step back because it is still somewhat off balance and I have to learn to think on my feet after the spin move to see what shots are available to me.


Get 50 r 44
Get 50 l 36

Coach I got 49/50 on regular 1 handed form shots on my right 

Wow! Amazing stuff!

Derek Simmons:
	Get 50 r 40
	Get 50 l 35

Kabir Patel:
	Things I want to remember

How to wall up against bigger or stronger players

How to push the ball into space to make my moves quicker

How to push back against someone trying to back me down

the biggest thing I have to get into my head is to push back against someone pushing into me and staying wide as well when they try to push into me because sometimes I do just get caught up into blocking the ball. I have to also work on pushing the ball into space because when I was trying to do it I wasn’t pushing very far leading to me covering less ground than I needed to.



## 🤖 **Questions to Build Coach D Database:**

### **Solo Training Challenges:**

1. **"Coach, I'm training alone and missing a lot of shots. How do I stay motivated?"**
	1. You're not training alone. You're training in front of a packed arena. Use your imagination. See the crowd. The teammates. The opponents. Hear my voice saying you don't miss two shots in a row! And if you are still missing shots, go back to form shooting for five minutes.
2. **"My left hand still feels weak on drives. What can I do without a defender?"**
	1. Keep practicing everything left handed. Brushing your teeth. Eating with a fork. Get 50 left shooting drill. You have to get to a point where you don't think you have a weak hand. Remember: Nobody could tell whether Chris Paul was right handed or left handed because he was equally good with both. That's you.
3. **"I'm getting tired during Get 50. Should I rest or push through?"**
	1. Get 50 is not an endurance drill. It's form shooting. A warm up. If you are getting tired from Get 50, we need more conditioning drills.
4. **"How do I practice the kill dribble decision-making when I'm alone?"**
	1. Use your imagination. See the defender. Count down the shot clock in your head. Down 2 with 15 seconds left. Up 5 with a minute to go. Tied in the first quarter. To make better decisions when alone, we have to use our imaginations and create the chaos to learn how to make choices. But also remember that slow is smooth and smooth is fast. That hesi isn't fooling anyone if you can't sell it as a jumper.
5. **"I can't get my step back balanced without a defender. Any tips?"**
	1. Rep it out. If you can't find your balance without a defender, you certainly won't be able to find it with one. And remember what I always said last season: Think with your feet first. For a step back, push off the leg to create space. Always practice at game speed, creating game shots
6. **"My float dribbles aren't covering enough space. What am I doing wrong?"**
	1. Likely not moving fast enough without the ball in your hands. Or worried about taking to many steps and traveling. This is like a defensive slide but on offense. Rep it out by using one dribble where you would stand for a free throw and using your far hand to touch the elbow while your other hand prepares to receive the ball, then reverse it, bouncing the ball once where you would shoot a free throw while sliding to use that same hand touch the opposite elbow while your right hand receives the ball. Get into a rhythm. Listen to a song that sets the pace. The good news: You're working on defensive slides and floating with the ball on offense at the same time.

### **Mental Game in India:**

7. **"I'm feeling frustrated training by myself. Miss having a coach."**
	1. Watch some videos on YouTube of Kobe. He didn't always have a coach in the gym telling him what to do. That's discipline. The good news is I'll be here when you get back. You will have all this solo development data we can review. And we can use WhatsApp for communication. Also, consider asking someone from your family to rebound for you. Even if they aren't a coach, they can still help you train, and it's quality time spent with family.
8. **"How do I know if I'm improving without you watching my form?"**
	1. Every few days, have someone from your family do a short video of you doing basketball training. Text it to me, and I'll give you some feedback. But if you're missing a lot of shots, you know enough about your shot to self diagnose. Are you holding your finish? For form shooting and free throws are you finishing on your toes? Is your arc flat? Get your palm under the ball and push up. Missing left or right? Make sure you are using your first two fingers to release the ball with spin, like a two-seam fastball. 
9. **"I'm tired but only halfway through my session. What would you tell me?"**
	1. Do you think the Top 10 incoming freshmen you will be competing against at high school tryouts get tired halfway through a session? Training tired is like preparing for the fourth quarter. Anyone can train halfway. And some players can get more done in half a session than most players can in a full session. Which player are you?
10. **"Missing shots is getting in my head. How do I reset mentally?"**
	1. Great shooters have memories like a goldfish: 10 seconds, tops. Did you forget how to shoot a basketball? Great shooters also always think the next shot is going in. Always. When in doubt, go back to form shooting, make a bunch, and that is your reset.

### **Technique Without Feedback:**

11. **"How do I know if my shooting form is right when training alone?"**
	1. We already answered this, I think, but how does the shot feel? Because when it feels right, even if it misses, it probably is right. if it doesn't feel right, go back to form shooting to make it feel right.
12. **"I think I'm rushing my shots. How do I slow down but stay smooth?"**
	1. Remember what I always say: How is the photographer going to get a cover worth shot of you hitting the game winner if you don't hold your finish and pose for the camera? Quick release? Yes. Rushing: No. I think it was John Wooden who said "be quick but not in a hurry."
13. **"My one-leg shooting in Get 50 feels off. What should I focus on?"**
	1. Balance. Control. This isn't a shooting drill. It's the basketball version of leg day in speed & strength.
14. **"How do I practice 'attacking feet' when there's no defender?"**
	1. Ideally, two cones, but even two wadded up pieces of paper will do. Move them around as if they are your opponent's shoes, or even use an old pair of sneakers! And then practice attacking that high foot, as well as the low foot. Very few players play perfectly straight up, but practice that too. And remember: Sometimes your best first move is a counter-move.

**Team meeting:**

  

1) We have a head start because we all know each other pretty well. We're lucky that a lot of our families are good friends. But on the basketball court, we have to respect coach and player relationships. Use Jackson as an example. Just call me coach Derek. Coach Tony. Coach Jaimie.

  

2) I want you to all be mentally prepared for intense practices, starting tonight. We have to work hard. Really hard. I want us to have fun, but in order to do that, we have to be in great basketball shape. There will be times when you wonder why we are running so much or working so hard. Just embrace it. The payoff will be great, I promise. Basketball is a hard game to play when you are tired. We will work hard to be in great shape for games.

  

3) Lakeville South is the gold standard for 5th grade. Talent-wise, we are as good as they are. Absolutely. Where they separate from other teams is how they play together as a team. We need to learn to play as a team. Individual skills are great, but wins and losses are the result of team play. Look around you. These are your teammates. We are all equal. We rise together, we fall together. Everyone out here is your best friend. There are no favorites. If a person is open, you shouldn't hesitate to pass him the ball. Check all that other stuff at the door. 

  

4) Crazy stuff happens during a basketball game. It gets physical. It gets loud. Bad calls get made. Our job is to deal with all of that stuff and just play basketball. Tune it all out. Play your game as a team and the distractions won't matter. We will get better at basketball this season. All of your individual skills will improve. We'll learn to play together as a team. But we will also improve our emotional maturity. We will be good sports when we win and when we lose. We won't cry or whine or get frustrated when things don't go our way. Use all of that as fuel for basketball, not as something that takes you out of your game.

  

5) Anyone who has played for me know that I will be your biggest cheerleader and your harshest critic. I want to help you get better as basketball players and as teammates. Don't get upset when I get on you. Basketball or anything else worth being really good at isn't easy. And I will never get upset over missing shots or someone not being perfect. I will get upset over lack of effort or concentration. I'll call you out on it.

  

6) Practices will be hard, yes, but I want to reserve a little time at the end of each one for fun. But you have to earn that. The player who shows me something special during practice -- extra hustle, good communication, great focus, etc. -- will get to choose what we do for the last 10 minutes of practice. That will be your time. The rest of practice is mine.

Practice ideas

  

Quick feet and defensive slides (Called D-Time!)

(yell "stance", boys slap floor and yell "east ridge!" move ball from right to left, they move their feet and jump six inches right or left. Then add in side to side, front and back slides). Add in shot. End with that?

  

Three-man weave

Chest passes down and back

Full-court layups

Free throws (track them during the season; 30 per practice?)

  

  

ball handling

chris paul hard dribbles

isiah 7 (right, left, right front to back, left front to back, right side to side, left side to side, two balls)

static ball handling: around the ankles, around the knees, around the waist, reverse. between legs

full-court dribbles, crossovers; how many dribbles does it take? Six?

first dribble back from defender creates space; second dribble back creates vision

  

Triple threat (coach says)

  

pivot drills. ever in trouble? pivot!

(pivot for seven seconds with defender on you, and then make a pass. groups of threes.)

  

Defense

Four perimeter offensive players. Four defenders

Offense: Triple threat, then pass. Defense: Man up, passing lane, help defense

  

Defense: switch and change (5 on 5 o vs. man2man; switch o and d on halfcourt; change ends and switch too; drill should be tougher than the game; it's frantic and exhausting; good cardio without just running laps)

Defense: Deny and help (O guy up top wing with ball, defender on man at wing, guy on the other block, and his defender helps on D for the cutback. O guy on opposite wing to reverse it.)

  

Shooting

UCLA drill. Five players on each end. Two lines on wings. Player makes cut down low, then pops out to free throw line, receives pass and makes jump shot. After that, ball fake at free throw line and drive in for layups on each side. Passer gets rebound on jumpers. Passer goes around perimeter on layups.

  

Step Bys: Wing gets pass from point, Defender rushes in, wing quick head/ball fake, and then steps by the defender for a jumper. Three to right, and then three to left.

  

Modified Louisville drill (we call it Kentucky): two lines on wings at opposite ends of court. Right hand layups and then left. Two guys at opposite baskets throw ball off glass at same time and quick pass to outlet. Outlet passes back to him and then follows him down court. He gets ball after layup and swing to outlet on the other side. Keep going.

  

Badger: 3 on 3 half court passing game. Must make at least 10 passes without a turnover of any kind.

  

The Freaky Fast 15: Start with 2 on 1 (two trailers), come back with 3 on 2. Third and fourth trips down the court are press break (5 inbounds, 3-2-1 stack at free throw line, 4 at mid-court), fifth trip is read and react with five pass and cuts, then a score. Next five trips are fast breaks. 5 indounds to 1. 2 flies down and fills right baseline. 3 flies down and fills left baseline. 4 flies down and to left elbow. 5 is the trailer. All five players score in less than 45 seconds. Next five trips also fast break but with coach throwing ball off backboard for 5 to outlet to 1.

  

  

Lions in the cage: Find a square on the court. One player at each corner. This is the offense. Four players in the middle. This is the defense. Defense starts by tossing ball to one of the offensive players and then attacking defensively, trapping etc. Offense has to stay at the corners, can dribble once, but must sweep first. Every pass is a point. Two minutes and then switch. Team with the most points wins.

  

Dribble at but defense sags way off, reverse it and do a handoff.

  

Jayhawk at half and full speed. Get your nose on the ball. Turn and sprint if you have to. Square up, don't get turned.

  

Toughness: Pairs around 3-point arc. Defense harasses and even fouls a little. Offense has to pivot and sweep (don't rip through the middle; low or high; middle is where most tie-ups occur). Call out players name for a pass to coach. 30 seconds and switch.

  

Weak-hand passing and layups: Pairs start with right hand behind their backs. Pass and catch with just left hand, then advance to one dribble pass and catch. Alternate which foot goes forward. Go for 100 in a row without a drop. Layups: Right hand at side or behind back. Five cones at perimeter. Dribble around each and drive in for layup. Total of 20: near side with and without backboard and far side with and without backboard.

  

Read and React drills: Start with front and rear cuts from each side. Under hoop, one person at wing, one person at point. Defender underneath throws ball to top or wing, and then closes out. Offensive player swings it and then cuts to get the ball right back. Rotate. Next: Start at baseline with defender. Flash to wing with defender overplaying and cut to hoop. Point hits them for a layup. Both sides. Next: Same thing but from right wing to top (passer is on left wing). Next: Laker cuts. Player on block, one at left wing, line at top. Ball is at left wing. Pass to block and make a good cut. Player at top flashes to left wing to keep it going. Next: X cut. Same setup, except this time the wing fakes the cut (defender is playing way off), and then sets a pick for top, and THEN flashes to the hoop for the pass. Next: Same thing except this time we hit the point flashing to the wing for the open J. Next: Dribble at, starting from point to right wing with defender on wing. And then switch sides.

  

30-second drill: Five guys, pogo rebounding to start. When I say "GO!" guy grabs the rebound, takes it out of bounds, and we run the fast break to the other end. All five guys score in 30 seconds.

  

Three-man rebounding drill. Guy in the middle under hoop. Coach bounces ball and says "shot". Guy under hoop boxes out his man (fourth man), turns to get ball, and then scores on the two guys on the sides. Has to score three times before rotating.

  

Rebounding drills. Catch with two hands, chin it, clear, and then outlet. Go for rebounds. Weakside too!

  

Rebounding drills as a warmup

(off glass for pregame; in pairs across rim; single file throw grab pass)

  

Stretching and D-Time!

  

Go through "80" and "50" press (3-2 trapping zone)

  

Go through press break (Pippen: 2 to 1 with 5, 4 and 3 in backcourt; Jordan: 2 with 5, 1, 3, 4 in a line at FT line)

  

Offense vs. defense (10 passes or 1 steal to 5) in three offensive sets

  

Review set plays: 5-1, 4-1, 3-5, 2-4, 1-2, 1-3, etc.

  

Review inbounds plays (1 stack, 2 box, 3 box) and sideline wizard

  

Defense: Between basket and man at all times, help defense, one arm length away when your man has the ball, pressure, deny, work hard

  

If time: Shooting competition, Superman (rebounding from elbows, two lines), Zimmerman (half or full-court with cones, layups with defender chasing), Jayhawk (criss cross man on man, with free throws at each end)

2015 ERAA 4th B Postseason awards

  

  

Most Improved Player Award

35 Cayden Narum: Quiet and somewhat reserved, Cayden found his game a couple weeks into the season. He gobbled up key rebounds, played great defense and did everything we asked him to do. I remember one practice where I made you guys run like four killers in a row. I was yelling at you guys to finish strong, and there was Cayden at the end, sprinting to finish first. That wasn't the case at the beginning of the year. He got better each and every week to become one of the best big guys in 4th grade hoops.

  

Favorite moment: The clutch put-back jumper at the buzzer that helped get us to overtime vs. Apple Valley in their own tournament. We lost 39-37 in double overtime (gah!), but Cayden was huge in that game. If I remember correctly, he got banged up but still finished the game and had a bunch of rebounds (as usual). That was pretty much his thing every game.

  

Areas for improvement: Being stronger with the ball, whether it's when he is getting ready to pass or when grabbing a rebound. Loses the ball some when he isn't aggressive. Keep practicing big-man moves: drop steps on both sides of the basket, pogos and put backs, triple pivots and wheels, and spins under the hoop.

  

  

Tough As Nails Award

5 Jackson Simmons: Some people might think it's good to be a coach's son. Maybe even easy. Or maybe they get preferential treatment. Not the case if I'm the coach. I promise you I am tougher on him than I am on anyone else. And that's saying a lot, because I'm pretty tough. He didn't always do it with a dry eye, but he always gave everything he had. He played through bumps and bruises. He scored some tough baskets when we needed them most. He had blocks, steals, key rebounds and big defensive stops. He got from me some praise but a lot of critiquing. And he still loves basketball!

  

Favorite moment: Led us in scoring all three games of the Woodbury tournament and had a steal at the end of the Hopkins game in overtime that led to a missed layup. He was fouled really hard and couldn't shoot the free throws, but he gave us a chance with sheer will and determination. Tough as nails!

  

Areas for improvement: Changing speeds and control as a ball handler. Seeing the court. Better defensive pressure. Shot selection. Crisper passes. Complete 20,000 shot club and ramp up intensity of morning workouts. You have to push harder if you want to get better.

  

  

The Five-Tool Player Award

33 Brady Burns: That's really a baseball thing; the five-tool player. But it is symbolic of the player who can do it all. And for our team, that was Brady. He can play any position on the court. He can shoot from the outside or drive to the basket. He can pass, dribble, defend, rebound and run the court. He loves to play the game, and it shows. As fun as it was to watch him do his thing on the offensive side of the court, I really enjoyed seeing him get fired up on defense. It means he's on his way to becoming a complete player.

  

Favorite moment: The 3-pointer against Hastings in the championship of the Cottage Grove tournament. We got back in that game after being down by double digits, and his big shot pulled us to within a basket. The crowd when absolutely bananas. It felt like a high school game! That was a big-time shot.

  

Areas for improvement: Keep working on confidence and attitude. Basketball is a physical game, and you must keep your wits about you when things get tough. It's not easy, and some of that will come with age. But be aware of it and try to channel those emotions into fiery defense! Overall, you are at your best when you are being aggressive and show no signs of hesitation. Be assure of yourself. Don't worry about failing or falling short. That's going to happen to everyone. So do so from time to time but do it by going all out. Keep working on ball handing and vertical dribbling ... beating your man and making him move north and south to guard you rather than laterally. Work on crisp passes. No lolipops.

  

  

Big Shot / Big Steal Award

23 Devin Connelly: Nobody had more key steals or as many big baskets as this dude. I wish I had a dollar for every time he picked some poor kid's pocket and drove down for a layup. I could have used those dollars to pay for all that ice cream! He's the only kid who has ever challenged me to a half-court shooting contest. I think you all know how that turned out. I think he easily set an ER single-season steals record for 4th grade.

  

Favorite moment: Have to give this one some more thought. Seems like there was a game where he stole the ball from the same kid like five times in the same game and got his parents all worked up. Devin's defense will do that to you. And he fouled out more than any other player. Another sign of his aggressive play on defense.

  

Areas for improvement: Learn to dribble well with left hand, especially on left side of the court. Work on when to go for the steal and when to move your feet and just play great defense. Work on playing good defense off ball, which includes having your hands out and seeing both the ball and your man. Develop some offensive moves: ball and shot fakes, drop steps, drop spins, pivots and wheels. Get creative with and without the ball.

  

  

Always On Award

4 Will McGurran: Always smiling, always in a good mood, always ready to ball -- that's our Will. Almost all of our players had ups and downs, but Will was just always up and on, even when he was getting knocked to the floor driving to the hoop! One of a few guys to hit a 3 in a game, he also got key steals and rebounds, and I was always looking for a way to get him in the mix. He makes any group of 5 better.

  

Favorite moment: Definitely not some of those 3s, which I know you almost can't help yourself from shooting. I know how it feels to be there. I played in plenty of games where I was "always open". My favorite Will moment was probably the first Edina team we played in the Eden Prairie tournament. He had two or three steals to start the game and layups that might have or might have not gone in. I can't remember that part. But he was on fire to give us a great start to the game. The other coach was super frustrated.

  

Areas for improvement: More time playing basketball and really focusing on doing the little things right: Making sharp, crisp passes, working without the ball, setting good picks, being court aware, playing good help defense, communicating and so on. Working a lot on his left hand will help develop his ball skills. Catching the ball in triple threat to be prepared for multiple actions (not just driving to the basket or shooting an open jumper). Will can get to the basket almost anytime he wants, but he needs to work on various moves on the way there to open up some other options like a pull-up jumper, a pass, a fake, etc.

  

  

Dedication Award

10 Tyler Reynolds: It was a couple of tournaments into the season when I realized Tyler was like glue on defense. I put him on one of the best players toward the end of one of our close games, and he was like glue. He plays the kind of game a coach loves: super tough but smart defense and intelligent offense that often ended with him driving to the basket for a basket. I don't think anyone on our team was better at getting to the hoop as often and with more success than Tyler. Even before practices, he was always working on his game and developing his moves. If we had runner-up awards, he would get another one for most improved. The basketball player he is today is significantly better than the one from our first day of practice. And that's all about effort.

  

Favorite moment: He went on a scoring tear in one of our games at Scott Highland Middle (we played a lot of game there). I think it was against Shakopee? Anyway, he scored a few baskets and then had a deal with his dad that if he got one more he'd get some kind of bonus. Not sure the amount. He missed a couple of shots, and then got another bucket. I think he and Dave exchanged glances on his way back down the court. It was an impressive effort, and one I've come to expect from Tyler.

  

Areas for improvement: Being stronger with the ball in a stationary position. Work on getting in a strong triple threat position when you catch the ball, and then a lot of options will be open to you based on what the defense is doing. Work on your ball handling as much as possible, including your left hand and looking up and seeing the court. Adding a step-back jump shot to your offensive skills would really bolster your game and make you even harder to defend.

  

  

Calm, Cool and Collected Award

3 Braeden Askew: Good luck trying to rattle this kid. I don't think it is possible. Either that, or he does an excellent job of hiding it. We put Braeden in all kinds of difficult situations this year, and he kept his composure through all of it. Whether he was making a big shot, getting a key steal or grabbing an important rebound, Braeden's emotions always ran about the same. That kind of player is important to a coach, especially one who isn't always calm, cool or collected. Braeden was our rock throughout the entire season.

  

Favorite moment: His big baskets against IGH in the Roseville tournament. The first one was impressive. He pump faked just above the elbow, and then took two dribbles in closer before making it. He followed that up with a couple of more, and we rolled to our biggest win of the season, 41-15.

  

Areas for improvement: Quicker decision making is at the top of my list. There were several times this year that Braeden had the right idea about what to do, it just took a bit too long to get there. So I'd have him work on catching the ball in strong triple-threat position, and then see the court to quickly make his next move, whether it's a crisp pass, a quick jump shot, or a dribble-drive around his defender. Invest in an agility ladder if you want, and have him work on his foot speed in the basement. You could also include his lateral slides as well as high knees. Fundamentally, Braeden is solid. He's a smart player and, when given enough time, can make good decisions. Getting there more quickly will really improve his overall game.

  

  

Heart and Hustle Award

21 Ben Jordan: Always hustling, always getting rebounds with the big guys down low, always working hard; That's Ben Jordan. And a great attitude too. Never saw him sulk or pout or fuss one little bit. In fact, he usually has a smile on his face. He loves to play basketball, and it shows. A player like that is the heart and soul of a team. A player who puts everything he has into every trip up and down the court.

  

Favorite moment: Multiple games (seemingly every game) I have this vision of him pulling down a big rebound down low that I wonder how in the heck he managed to pull off. He has a natural knack for basketball that is only going to get better as he gets older.

  

Areas for improvement: Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble. Ben has some natural skills as a point guard and ball handler, and he could develop into a good one if he spends extra time developing his handle and ability to see the court while working the floor. So not just working on his left hand, but also working on changing speeds and backing up while dribbling. Developing his strength for longer jump shots will also help his overall game.

  

  

Go-Getter Award

11 Ben Karrow: Never afraid to mix it up, there were countless times Ben was on the floor fighting for a loose ball or driving to the hoop trying to beat a defense. And his play really inspired our team to play tough. We lost a bit of that when he broke his arm and missed the final four tournaments of the year. We weren't the same team without his aggressiveness. We really missed having him out there.

  

Favorite moment: Ben had plenty of big baskets, rebounds, steals and so on, but my favorite moments happened when he was fighting for possession of a basketball. He's not a kid I ever had to remind to fight hard. He would try his best to get it unitl the whistle blew. And sometimes even after the whistle. He has a competitive spirit that coaches love. I think my favorite moment was probably lost when Ben broke his arm. Such a huge loss for us because he was getting so much better, and his best basketball is yet to come.

  

Areas for improvement: Did Ben break his right arm? If so, I would use that as an opportunity for him to work really hard on dribbling with his left hand. Get him in a gym or a basement and have him work with that left hand as much as possible. If there's a silver lining in breaking a bone, it may be that he will be forced to not rely on his dominant hand. Outside of that, I'd work with him on seeing the court as a ballhandler. Ben has natural ability with the ball, but he sometimes got into trouble when trying to drive into defenders. I'd also have him work on passing and defense. He's naturally aggressive, with is fantastic, but he needs to work on situational defense and seeing the court on that end as well. Sometimes he gets turned around and/or loses track of his man.

  

  

Tower of Power Award

15 Nick Grannis: Nick was our bruiser this season, getting a ton of key rebounds and setting some great picks for our guards and small forwards. We relied on his heavily down low, and he came through time and again with many big rebounds. He ws our Tower of Power, but he's also a gentle giant and one of the nicest kids I know. He's a great teammate and a Can Do kid.

  

Favorite moment: It came in the Roseville Tournament, maybe during the game against Inver Grove Heights? We ran our No. 2 inbounds play, and Nick did a great job of setting a pick up high, and then rolling to the basket underneath. He was wide open and made a big layup. In fact, he may have done that a couple of times that weekend. It was great to see the team figure out that play and score some baskets using it.

  

Areas for improvement: Nick has a really high ceiling when it comes to the sport of basketball. I think he can get a lot better, and I saw flashes of it throughout the season. At the top of my list would be better control and confidence when he receives the ball. He needs to develop a wide base and good triple threat position, which will help when all those pesky defenders are trying to get the ball from him. He could be a real threat down low, and I'd have him work on big man post moves down there, including a big drop step to the hoop, and using his pivot foot to negotiate defenders. Again, a wide base paired with more confidence and aggressiveness will go a long way to facilitating that improvement. Additionally, I'd work with him in terms of running the court, whether it's getting back on defense or the fast break in transition. Like all of our playes, he could also get better at working the half court in our offense when he doesn't have the ball.
