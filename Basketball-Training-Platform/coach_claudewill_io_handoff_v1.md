# COACH.CLAUDEWILL.IO - Project Handoff

## Core Decision: Repository, Not Platform

**What it is:** A place where Coach D's basketball tools and resources naturally accumulate over time.

**What it's not:** A business to run, platform to maintain, or massive 2026 launch commitment.

**The model:** 
- Build tools when you need them (like today's lineup builder)
- Document resources as you create them (Tim's curriculum, training plans)
- Organize them in one discoverable place
- Let it grow organically

**Philosophy:** "We built an app that works in a few hours. It would have taken nearly as long to find a PDF and fill it in. That's the whole game."

## Key Naming Decisions

### URL
✅ **coach.claudewill.io** (clean, no hyphen, no "d")

### Brand
✅ **Coach D** (not "The CW Fieldhouse" - avoiding CW overload)

**Reasoning:**
- CW Strategies = consulting business
- The CW Standard = AI ethics framework  
- CW agent = AI assistant/clone
- Coach D = basketball coaching identity

Keep them distinct. Parents/players think "Coach D," not "CW."

### Organizational Metaphor
✅ **Fieldhouse structure** (but simplified)

Coaches understand facilities. Different spaces for different purposes. Authentic sports language.

---

## Site Structure (Simplified)

**Main Areas:**

🏀 **Main Court** - Core methodology (BLAST system, philosophy, training systems)

📋 **Practice Gym** - Tools & templates (lineup builder, practice plans, downloadable resources)

🎬 **Film Room** - Case studies (Kabir breakthrough, player development stories)

🏢 **Coach D's Office** - About, contact, work with me

🎟️ **Will Call** - Training sessions, team packages, purchases

📊 **Banners** - User dashboard for progress tracking (if we add user accounts later)

**Reference Material:** PhoenixGrind-Arena.txt has full fieldhouse architecture with Trophy Case, Hall of Fame, Trainer's Room, Weight Room, Press Room, and specialized coach offices. Available when we want more complexity.

## What Exists Today

✅ **WAA Lineup Builder** - Built and used today, won the game, saved from technical foul
- Lives at: /mnt/user-data/outputs/WAA_Lineup_Builder_Complete.html
- Proof of concept for "tools coaches actually need"
- Took hours to build, solved immediate problem

---

## Integration with Existing Portfolio

**Current ecosystem:**
- claudewill.io - Main hub
- bob.claudewill.io - (TBD)
- ebb-flo.claudewill.io - FloShake methodology
- **coach.claudewill.io - Basketball** (new)
- CW Strategies - Business entity

**Philosophy:** Not separate projects. Subdomains of same strategy — Derek helping people optimize performance across domains.

---

## Next Steps (When Ready)

1. **Simple landing page** for coach.claudewill.io
2. **Add lineup builder** to Practice Gym section
3. **Document Tim's BLAST curriculum** when partnership clarifies
4. **Write up Kabir case study** when story concludes
5. **Add tools as you build them** for actual needs

**No timeline pressure. No launch date. Just organization.**

## Key Quote

*"I have projects coming out my ears. I'm not saying we drag our feet in 2026. We could crank up a coach.claudewill.io presence pretty quickly with downloadable or usable apps, documents, case studies. But we also have bob, ebb-flo, CW, and claudewill.io. I-o, i-o, it's off to work I go!"*

**Translation:** This isn't a new project. It's organizing existing basketball work under its own subdomain.

## Design Notes

- No "pick your court" tagline (too cute)
- Will Call = perfect arena metaphor for purchases
- Keep it simple, authentic coach language
- Let the work speak for itself
- Simplified fieldhouse structure (not the full Phoenix Grind Arena complexity)
- "Coach D's Office" not "Claude Wisdom Salon"

## Context from Evening Conversation

**The breakthrough insight:**
Building custom tools faster than finding/adapting existing solutions for recurring coach problems. The lineup builder proved this — built in hours, worked immediately, solved real game-day stress.

**The tension resolved:**
Not choosing between massive HoopDreams platform vision vs. simple productivity tools. Just building a repository where useful basketball stuff accumulates naturally. No business model needed. No launch pressure. Just organization.

**What came before:**
- Extensive HoopDreams platform strategy docs (Anthropic acquisition vision, multi-sport expansion)
- Kabir's India training app concept
- Tim Levy/BLAST curriculum partnership (undefined status)
- Multiple naming explorations (Ulna, CoachFlo, Phoenix Grind Arena)
- Competitive research on FloState and other platforms

**What we learned today:**
Sometimes shipping a simple tool that solves an immediate problem (lineup builder) is worth more than months of strategic planning documents. Build what you need, when you need it.

**Status:** Conversation paused. Decisions captured. Ready to build when needed.
