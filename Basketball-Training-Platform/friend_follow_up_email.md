## Template A: SportsEngine Connection

**Subject:** Basketball Training App - Thanks for the SportsEngine insights!

Hey [Name],

Really appreciate you taking time to check out the basketball app today! Your perspective on [specific feedback they gave about sports tech/scaling/market] was super helpful.

Here's the app link again if you want to dig deeper: claudewill.io/basketball

A few thoughts based on our conversation:

• [Respond to their specific technical feedback]
• [Address any concerns they raised]  
• [Reference their SportsEngine insights]

The timing couldn't be better - Kabir literally got on the plane to India this morning, so we'll have 30 days of real usage data to see if this actually works for solo training.

I'll definitely keep you posted on what we learn. If the India testing validates what we're seeing, I think we're onto something that could really help kids who learn differently.

Thanks again for your insights! And if anything comes to mind about the SportsEngine journey or potential connections, I'm all ears.

Derek

P.S. - [Reference any specific connection or advice they mentioned]

## Template B: Michael Jordan Connection

**Subject:** Basketball Training App - Thanks for the coaching perspective!

Hey [Name],

Thanks for checking out the basketball app today! Given your legendary basketball background [reference their MJ connection appropriately], your take on whether this captures real coaching vs. generic tips was exactly what I needed to hear.

App link: claudewill.io/basketball

Really appreciated your thoughts on:

• [Their feedback on coaching authenticity]
• [Their basketball credibility perspective]
• [Any industry insights they shared]

The kid who inspired this (Kabir) just left for India this morning for a month of solo training. He has ADHD and autism, and said the app "really helps him stay organized" - which got me thinking we might have accidentally built something for a bigger market than just basketball.

I'll keep you posted on how his India training goes. If this actually helps him stay on track for 30 days solo, it could validate the whole approach.

Thanks again for your time and basketball wisdom!
