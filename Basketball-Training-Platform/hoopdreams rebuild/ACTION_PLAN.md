## 🔥 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

**Don't panic!** Here's what to do:

1. **Check browser console** - Red errors tell you what's wrong
2. **Verify imports** - Make sure all paths start with `@/`
3. **Confirm dependencies** - Lovable should auto-install
4. **Try hard refresh** - Cmd+Shift+R clears cache
5. **Check Lovable build logs** - Bottom of editor shows errors

**Common fixes:**
- Missing imports? Add them at top
- Component not found? Check shadcn/ui
- Routing broken? Verify react-router-dom
- Styles not working? Check Tailwind classes

## 🎤 WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT

"I built this complete investor demo in a few hours using human-AI collaboration. The homepage shows our value proposition, three breakthrough innovations, competitive differentiation, and market opportunity. CoachFlo chat actually works. Bank Shots calculator runs in real-time. Every stakeholder — players, parents, coaches — sees how HoopDreams solves their problem.

That's the proof-of-concept. If we can build this fast through AI collaboration, imagine what we can do for coaches trying to scale their expertise. That's HoopDreams. That's why we win."
