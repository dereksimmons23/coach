## 💡 The Meta Story

**This IS the proof-of-concept:**

"I built this entire investor demo in ~3 hours while working on another project. How? I gave Claude our strategic documents, and it autonomously built:
- 4 complete pages
- Interactive features
- Professional design
- All the content

That's human-AI collaboration solving the coaching scalability problem in real-time."

**Use this as your closing argument:** If we can build an investor demo this fast through AI collaboration, imagine what we can do for coaches trying to scale their expertise.

4. **Email Tim the link** right after: "Here's what I was trying to show you..."

The strategy is solid even if tech has hiccups.
