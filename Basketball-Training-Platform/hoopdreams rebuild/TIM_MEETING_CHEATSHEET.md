## 🎤 Answer Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from HomeCourt/Hoops/etc?**
A: They're drill libraries with generic tips. We preserve authentic coaching expertise. First AI that sounds like an actual coach because it IS an actual coach's methodology.

**Q: How do you make money if 30% train for free?**
A: That 30% is proof of engagement. High engagement = low churn = better lifetime value. Plus facility licensing, marketplace, and agency services.

**Q: Why would Nike/Anthropic buy you?**
A: Nike wants direct relationships with next-gen athletes — we have unprecedented engagement. Anthropic wants proof that Claude can enhance (not replace) human expertise — we've done it with coaching.

**Q: Can this work for other sports?**
A: Absolutely. The methodology is universal. Basketball is proof-of-concept, but we're building the coaching OS for all sports.

**Q: What do you need?**
A: $250-500K seed funding, technical co-founder, and strategic partnerships. 18-month runway to prove commercial viability, then acquisition.

## 🏀 The Meta Story (Save for End)

**Say this if it's going well:**

"Here's the real proof-of-concept: I built this entire investor demo in 3 hours while working on another project. How? I gave Claude our strategy documents and it autonomously built everything you're seeing — pages, interactive features, calculations, the whole thing.

That's human-AI collaboration in action. If AI can help me build a platform to scale my coaching expertise this fast, imagine what we can do for every coach in every sport.

That's HoopDreams. That's the future of athletic development."

## 🚨 Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Market is crowded" | "None of them solve retention or mental performance. We're not competing with apps — we're replacing private coaching." |
| "How do you scale coaching?" | "That's exactly what we've solved. CoachFlo preserves methodology while scaling infinitely." |
| "Kids won't pay attention" | "Bank Shots gives them financial incentive. Train 4x/week = free. That's unprecedented alignment of interests." |
| "Seems expensive to build" | "MVP is done. Built on Lovable platform. Next phase needs mobile apps and video analysis — that's the funding ask." |

## 🎯 End Strong

**Final Statement:**
"Every player deserves expert coaching. Every coach deserves to scale their impact. We've built the technology, the business model, and the path to acquisition. The only question is: are you in?"
