## **SESSION STRUCTURE** (60-Minute Format)

### **Phase 1: Connection & Assessment** (2-5 minutes)
### **Phase 2: Foundation - Hand Strength** (10-12 minutes)
### **Phase 3: Control Recovery** (8-10 minutes)
### **Phase 4: Progressive Contact** (12-15 minutes)
### **Phase 5: Cognitive Load Integration** (10-12 minutes)
### **Phase 6: Contact Finishing** (12-15 minutes)
### **Phase 7: Mental Reinforcement** (3-5 minutes)

---

## **PHASE 1: CONNECTION & ASSESSMENT** (2-5 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Establish psychological safety
- Assess athlete's current physical and mental state
- Set tone for session
- Create rapport and trust

### **Activity: Casual Shoot Around**

**Structure**:
- Athlete takes 8-10 shots from comfortable spots
- Coach observes body language, confidence level, energy
- Light conversation about recent games, school, life
- No formal instruction yet — just connecting

**Coach Observations to Note**:
- Energy level (high/medium/low)
- Confidence indicators (eye contact, posture, shooting rhythm)
- Physical state (tired, sore, healthy)
- Mental state (focused, distracted, anxious)

**Transition Statement** (After Assessment):
*"Alright, let's get to work. Today we're focused on [primary objective]. I'm going to challenge you, but everything we do builds on itself. You ready?"*

---

## **PHASE 2: FOUNDATION - HAND STRENGTH & CONTROL** (10-12 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Build foundational hand strength
- Develop aggressive ball control
- Create success early in session
- Establish proper finishing form

### **Drill 1: Back-to-Basket Control Series**

**Setup**:
- Start with back to basket (6-8 feet away)
- Ball in hands, no dribble yet
- Simulated defender behind (no live defense yet)

**Movement Sequence**:
1. Between legs to opposite hand
2. Snatch ball aggressively with receiving hand
3. Spin toward basket
4. High, soft bank shot from 5-6 feet at 45-degree angle

**KEY COACHING CUE**: *"Hear the ball pop in your hands"*

**What "Pop" Means**:
- Ball makes audible sound when snatched
- Indicates proper grip strength and aggression
- Gives athlete immediate auditory feedback
- Builds confidence through sensory confirmation

**Progressions**:
1. **Level 1**: Slow motion, focus on hand position and control
2. **Level 2**: Game speed movement, maintain control
3. **Level 3**: Add verbal count or cognitive element

**Volume**: 
- 10-15 reps right hand finish
- 10-15 reps left hand finish
- Total: 20-30 reps

**Success Criteria**:
- Hearing consistent "pop" sound
- Smooth, confident movement
- High finishing percentage (70%+)
- Athlete showing increased confidence

**Common Issues & Corrections**:
- *Weak snatch*: "Grab it like you're mad at it"
- *No pop sound*: "Squeeze harder at the catch point"
- *Rushing movement*: "Slow down, let's hear that pop every time"
- *Missing finishes*: "Arc it higher, soft touch on the glass"

**Platform Integration Notes**:
- Video demonstration with audio enhanced to hear "pop"
- Side-by-side comparison of weak vs. strong snatch
- Rep counter integration
- Progress tracking for hand strength metrics

## **PHASE 3: CONTROL RECOVERY** (8-10 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Teach recovery when control is challenged
- Build confidence in chaos
- Strengthen hands through high-impact dribbling
- Develop adaptability under pressure

### **Drill 2: One-Hand Cross Dribbles (Forced Control)**

**Setup**:
- Full court (or half court if space limited)
- One ball
- Focus on one hand at a time

**Execution - Right Hand**:
1. Start at baseline, ball in right hand
2. Cross dribble (right to left) staying with right hand
3. Pound ball so hard it approaches losing control
4. Force right hand to recover and maintain control
5. Change speeds (sometimes slow, sometimes fast)
6. Repeat down and back

**Execution - Left Hand**:
- Same sequence with left hand
- Down and back

**KEY COACHING CUE**: *"Pound it to the point of losing control, then make your hands get it back"*

**Progressions**:
1. **Level 1**: Moderate speed, 70% intensity
2. **Level 2**: Game speed, 85% intensity
3. **Level 3**: Sprint speed, 95% intensity (controlled chaos)
4. **Level 4**: Add between-legs or behind-back at endpoints

**Volume**:
- 2-3 trips down and back per hand
- 4-6 total trips

**Success Criteria**:
- Ball stays under control despite aggressive pounding
- Athlete recovers when control is challenged
- Hands visibly strengthening (less loss of control over reps)
- Confidence evident in willingness to push limits

**Common Issues & Corrections**:
- *Too tentative*: "Harder! I want to see you almost lose it"
- *Actually losing control*: "That's good — now show me you can get it back"
- *Inconsistent pounding*: "Every single dribble should be aggressive"
- *Favoring one hand*: "Your weak hand needs this most"

**Platform Integration Notes**:
- Video showing proper intensity level
- Slow-motion of recovery technique
- Audio cues for pounding rhythm
- Tracking recovery speed improvement over time

## **PHASE 4: PROGRESSIVE CONTACT INTRODUCTION** (12-15 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Gradually introduce physical pressure
- Maintain skill execution under contact
- Build confidence through incremental challenges
- Simulate game-realistic defending

### **Drill 3: Between-Between-Behind with Contact**

**Base Drill** (Review if Needed):
- Between-legs dribble
- Between-legs dribble
- Behind-back dribble
- Pull-up jumper from elbow

**Setup**:
- Start at elbow (free throw line extended)
- Execute dribble combo
- Move to middle of free throw line
- Alternate sides each rep

**Progressive Contact Levels**:

**Level 1: No Contact Baseline**
- Execute base drill to establish rhythm
- 3-5 reps to build confidence
- Should have 80%+ success rate before advancing

**Level 2: Blocking Pad Contact (.5 Defense)**
- Coach holds football blocking pad
- Applies light pressure during dribble sequence
- Athlete must maintain control and execute move
- Volume: 5-8 reps

**Level 3: After-Shot Drive**
- After executing jumper, coach retrieves ball
- Coach walks back toward athlete
- Athlete must catch, drive, snatch, pound, and finish at rim
- Coach applies moderate contact in paint
- Volume: 5-8 reps

**Level 4: Full Sequence**
- Combine: between-between-behind → jumper → immediate drive to finish
- Contact on both jumper and finish
- Volume: 3-5 reps

**KEY COACHING PROGRESSION**: *"We're adding contact slowly. First the jumper, then the finish. Your job is to maintain your technique even when I'm applying pressure."*

**Success Criteria**:
- Technique remains consistent despite contact
- Athlete doesn't shy away from pressure
- Finishing percentage stays above 60% with contact
- Confidence visible in body language and aggression

**Common Issues & Corrections**:
- *Avoiding contact*: "Come right at me, don't drift away"
- *Losing technique under pressure*: "Same move, just with a body on you"
- *Weak finishes*: "Strong through the contact, don't let me push you off"
- *Rushing*: "Control first, speed second"

**Platform Integration Notes**:
- Video comparison: no contact vs. with contact
- Slow-motion showing maintained technique
- Force sensors (future) measuring contact tolerance
- Progressive unlock system based on success rates

## **PHASE 5: COGNITIVE LOAD INTEGRATION** (10-12 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Simulate mental fatigue of games
- Develop decision-making under pressure
- Build mental toughness
- Create consequences for execution

### **Drill 4: The 100 Drill (Cognitive + Physical Challenge)**

**Setup**:
- Start at mid-court with ball
- D-man defender at top of key
- Coach controls defender position

**Execution Sequence**:
1. **Triple Combo Move** at mid-court (any three-move combination)
2. **Call Out First Number**: Starting at 100
3. **Attack**: Drive toward defender at key
4. **Read Defense**: Coach leans defender left or right
5. **React**: Skip/drive opposite direction of lean
6. **Finish**: One-dribble pull-up jumper at elbow
7. **Calculate in Air**: Count backward by 7, call out next number
8. **Scoring**: Make shot = advance to next number. Miss = restart at 100

**Example Flow**:
- Start: 100 → drive and make shot → 93
- Next: 93 → drive and make shot → 86
- Next: 86 → drive and MISS shot → back to 100
- Continue until reaching 0

**KEY COACHING CUE**: *"Your brain needs to work while your body is tired. That's what games feel like."*

**Progressions**:
1. **Level 1**: Count backward by 5 (easier math)
2. **Level 2**: Count backward by 7 (standard)
3. **Level 3**: Count backward by 9 (harder math)
4. **Level 4**: Add specific finishing requirements (floater only, reverse lay only, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:
- Athlete maintains focus on counting
- Makes at least 50% of shots
- Decision-making remains sharp despite cognitive load
- Shows resilience when having to restart

**Common Issues & Corrections**:
- *Forgetting numbers*: "That's okay, it means your brain is working. What number are we at?"
- *Rushing shots*: "Slow down, make good decisions even when you're thinking"
- *Giving up*: "This is where mental toughness is built. Keep going"
- *Missing basic math*: "Don't overthink it, quick calculation and move on"

**Platform Integration Notes**:
- Gamification with leaderboards (fastest completion times)
- Tracking success rates under cognitive load
- Video showing decision-making process
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance
- Math difficulty settings customizable

## **PHASE 6: CONTACT FINISHING - THE BREAKTHROUGH** (12-15 Minutes)

### **Purpose**
- Apply all previous skills in game-realistic setting
- Build true contact confidence
- Teach optimal finishing positioning
- Create breakthrough moments

### **Drill 5: Wing Drive with Help Defense**

**Setup**:
- Ball on ground at wing (behind three-point line)
- D-man defender in front of ball
- Coach positioned as help defender in paint (location varies)

**Execution Sequence**:
1. **Athletic Grab**: Stay low, grab ball with purpose
2. **Beat Primary**: Attack past D-man defender
3. **Read Help**: Identify where coach is positioned as help
4. **Attack Honey Hole**: Drive to optimal finishing position
5. **Finish Strong**: Complete through contact

**THE CRITICAL CONCEPT: "Honey Hole"**

**Definition**: *The optimal finishing position — right in front of the rim, slightly closer than the free throw line, balanced foundation, multiple finishing options*

**Why It Matters**:
- Gives athlete specific target (not vague "be aggressive")
- Explains the strategic reason for positioning
- Provides multiple finishing options once there
- Creates confidence through understanding

**Honey Hole Benefits**:
- Strong, balanced base
- Can finish left, right, or center
- Protected from shot blocking
- Natural shooting pocket
- Not trapped baseline or too deep

**KEY COACHING PROGRESSION**:

**First Reps** (Common Issues):
- Shying away from contact
- Getting too far under rim (trapped)
- Finishing weak instead of strong
- Poor positioning (too deep left or right)

**Coaching Intervention**:
*"Stop. Let me show you something. See this spot right here? [Point to honey hole] This is where you want to get. From here, you're balanced, you have options, and I can't take away your shot. Don't get trapped down here [point to under basket]. Get to the honey hole."*

**After Coaching** (Expected Improvement):
- Athlete targets honey hole specifically
- Much better positioning
- Stronger finishes
- More confidence attacking contact
- Higher finishing percentage

**Volume**:
- 5-8 reps with coach providing feedback
- 5-8 reps with athlete self-coaching
- Total: 10-16 finishes

**Progression Variations**:

**Level 1: Stationary Help**
- Coach stays in one spot
- Athlete learns to find honey hole from different angles

**Level 2: Moving Help**
- Coach shifts position
- Athlete must read and adjust

**Level 3: Multiple Helpers**
- Add second coach or dummy defender
- Simulate true game traffic

**Level 4: Live Defense**
- Full speed, competitive finish
- Consequence for weak attempts

**Success Criteria**:
- Athlete consistently targets honey hole
- Finishing percentage improves (60%+ through contact)
- Body language shows confidence
- Athlete demonstrates understanding of positioning concept
- Can self-coach ("I need to get to the honey hole")

**Common Issues & Corrections**:
- *Still avoiding contact*: "You're drifting. Come right at me to the honey hole"
- *Getting stuck deep*: "Too far! Honey hole is HERE [point]"
- *Weak finishes*: "Strong! You're in the perfect spot, now finish through me"
- *Losing confidence*: "That's a great attempt. Your positioning was perfect. Finish will come"
