## Platform Considerations

- Mobile app (yet)

**Just organizing:**

- Case studies and resources
- Professional credentials

### Future Platform Possibilities

**If this evolves naturally:**
- Simple static site with navigation
- Tool hosting (HTML/JS tools like lineup builder)
- Downloadable resources
- Contact/booking form

**What would trigger platform development:**
- Regular requests from other coaches
- Clear demand for organized access
- Natural growth of tool collection
- Time/resources available for proper build
