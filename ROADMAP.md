## Success Metrics

**Not revenue. Not user count. Just:**

- Tools that solve real problems
- Content that helps players develop
- Resources that save coaches time
- Stories that inspire better coaching
- Systems that actually get used

**The measure:** Did this make coaching easier or better?

---

## Timeline Philosophy

**No launch dates. No pressure. Just:**

- Build when it's useful
- Document when it's ready
- Share when it helps
- Improve when there's time

**The approach:** Organic accumulation, not forced delivery.
