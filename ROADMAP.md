# Coach D Repository - Roadmap

**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025
**Repository:** [github.com/dereksimmons23/coach](https://github.com/dereksimmons23/coach)

## Vision: Coach D as AI Agent

**Not a website. An AI Director of Basketball Operations.**

The repository is the knowledge base. Coach D is the interface.

Same architecture as CW:
- Claude API + system prompt + Netlify serverless function
- Conversational interface
- Trained on your specific methodology

## Success Metrics

**Not revenue. Not user count. Just:**

- Tools that solve real problems
- Content that helps players develop
- Resources that save coaches time
- Stories that inspire better coaching
- Systems that actually get used

**The measure:** Did this make coaching easier or better?

---

## Timeline Philosophy

**No launch dates. No pressure. Just:**

- Build when it's useful
- Document when it's ready
- Share when it helps
- Improve when there's time

**The approach:** Organic accumulation, not forced delivery.
