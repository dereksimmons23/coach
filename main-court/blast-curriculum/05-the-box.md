## Coaching Notes

**Common Errors:**
- Not changing levels (cross must be LOW)
- Retreat dribbles without looking over shoulder
- Rushing the mini hop (needs to be controlled)
- Not squaring shoulders to basket before cross

**Cues:**
- "Change levels and speed"
- "Look over your shoulder on the retreat"
- "Cross VERY LOW"
- "Square your shoulders before the cross"

**Why It's Called "The Box":**
The footwork pattern traces a box shape on the court as you move forward, retreat, and cross back.
