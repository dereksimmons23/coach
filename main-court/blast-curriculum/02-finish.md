# Finish

**Category 2 of 16** | Rim finishes and layup variations

## Overview

Finishing at the rim is where points are scored. This category progresses from basic layups to advanced finishes that create space and absorb contact.

**Progression:**
- **Travel:** Basic layups, scoops, 2-ball coordination
- **Varsity:** Inside hand, pro hop, euro step, reverse
- **Recruit:** Outside foot plant, advanced gathers

## Coaching Notes

**Common Errors:**
- Gathering too early (travel)
- Not protecting the ball on pro hops
- Euro step without changing angle
- Reverse without using the rim as protection

**Cues:**
- "Drop your shoulders downhill"
- "Circle the ear" (on gathers)
- "Be ready for contact"
- "Land in your shooting pocket"
