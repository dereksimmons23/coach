## Coaching Notes

**Common Errors:**
- Not setting up the screen (going too fast)
- Not reading the defense (predetermined decisions)
- Standing up while using screen (stay low)
- Not attacking downhill on hip pocket read
- Forcing passes into hedge

**Cues:**
- "Lowest athlete wins"
- "Bring your defender below the screen first"
- "Read the defense, don't predetermine"
- "Turn the corner and get DOWNHILL"
- "If they hedge, your big is open"

**Why This Matters:**
The ball screen creates 2-on-1 advantages. If you can read the defense and make the right play, you're unguardable. If you can't read, the defense controls you.
