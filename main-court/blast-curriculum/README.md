# BLAST HOOPS Trainer Guide

**Phoenix Grind Basketball Training Curriculum**

---

## Overview

BLAST is a progressive skill development system designed by Tim Levy. Each drill builds foundational skills that transfer to game situations.

**Philosophy:** Master the fundamentals at each level before advancing. Every drill has a purpose. Every rep matters.

---

## Levels

| Level | Ages | Ball Size | Rim Height | Focus |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Travel** | 2nd-8th grade | 28.5 (youth) / 29.5 (6th+) | 7.5-10ft | Foundation, rhythm, basic moves |
| **Varsity** | 9th-12th grade | 28.5 (girls) / 29.5 (boys) | 10ft | Complexity, combinations, game reads |
| **Recruit** | 9th-12th grade | 28.5 (girls) / 29.5 (boys) | 10ft | Advanced moves, situational mastery |

### Level Codes

When a drill is marked with a level code, it indicates which levels should train that drill:

- **T** = Travel only
- **V** = Varsity only
- **R** = Recruit only
- **TVR** = All levels
- **VR** = Varsity + Recruit
- **TR** = Travel + Recruit

**Modifications:**

## Training Phases

Every drill progresses through four phases:

1. **In Training** - Learning the movement pattern
2. **Gametime Application** - Applying to game situations
3. **Muscle Memory** - Repetition until automatic
4. **Skill Mastery** - Consistent execution under pressure

## Key Coaching Cues

- "Knees 90 degrees, butt down"
- "Shoulders over knees"
- "Feet outside shoulders"
- "LET IT BURN" (embrace the conditioning)
- "Pound to the point of losing control"
- "Land with the basketball in your shooting pocket"
