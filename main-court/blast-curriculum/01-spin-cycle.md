# Spin Cycle

**Category 1 of 16** | Pivot and spin moves to create separation

---

## Overview

Spin moves are essential for creating space and changing direction. This category builds from basic pivots to advanced spin combinations with finishes.

**Progression:**
- **Travel:** Forward/reverse pivots, basic pivot-cross combos
- **Varsity:** Pound hop spins with punch dribble finishes
- **Recruit:** Complex spin entries (behind back, between legs, shimmy variations)

## Coaching Notes

**Common Errors:**
- Not staying low through the spin (rising up loses power)
- Spinning without loading/exploding (lazy spins get picked)
- Punch dribble not synced with foot (hand and foot must land together)
- Not protecting ball through the spin

**Cues:**
- "Lean aggressively in the direction you're spinning"
- "Engage your toes for balance"
- "Right hand, right foot together" (on punch)
- "Tuck it like a running back"
