## Training Philosophy

**Before discussing packages:**

Basketball training is an investment in your child's development. Good coaching matters. But it's important to be realistic about what training can and cannot do.

**Training can:**
- Improve fundamental skills
- Build basketball IQ
- Develop mental toughness
- Create love for the game
- Provide positive mentorship

**Training cannot:**
- Guarantee college scholarships
- Replace team practice or game experience
- Overcome lack of effort or commitment
- Work if the player doesn't want it
- Substitute for good parenting

**The question isn't "Can you make my kid play in the NBA?"**  
**The question is "Will this help my kid fall in love with getting better?"**

If the answer is yes, training is worth it.
